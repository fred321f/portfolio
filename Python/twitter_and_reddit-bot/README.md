# Tweeting Reddit scraper bot
## Description
This project is a scraper of sorts, that uses the "praw" and "tweepy" python libraries. It's sole purpose (and rather, it's only function) is to read from the "r/AskReddit" subreddit, and post the top post on twitter. It does all this once executed, and the initial idea when I started developing it was to make it suitable for running on a RaspberryPi once every day.
